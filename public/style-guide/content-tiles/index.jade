          p Content tiles are the basis of all content on the site, particularly in Fashion, Lifestyle &amp; Interiors and Insight. They can have a 
            strong thumbnail image
            | , a 
            strong category
            | , a 
            strong title
            | , a 
            strong description
            | , a 
            strong date
            |  and an 
            strong author(s)
            | .
          p There are three main variants of the content tile; standard (
            code .content-tile
            | ), featured (
            code .content-tile.content-tile--featured
            | ) and small (
            code .content-tile.content-tile--small
            | ). There are also variants for different content types that require slightly different markup; video (
            code .content-tile.content-tile--video
            | ) and city by city (
            code .content-tile.content-tile--city-by-city
            | ).
          p All these variants use the same base styling, with elements altered where need be.
          p Content tiles take up the entire width of their parent, so you can and should use them in the grid, and their accents will take on the product's 
            a.styled(href='/product-colors') colour
            |  when 
            code body
            |  has a product class, such as 
            code .fashion
            | , which it should always have.
